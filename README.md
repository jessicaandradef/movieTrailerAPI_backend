# Movie Trailer Rating API

## Project Overview

The Movie Trailer Rating API is a powerful backend solution designed to support a website where users can explore and watch movie trailers. This API provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for users to discover movie trailers, access detailed movie information, rate and comment their favorite films. To unlock premium features such as rating movies, users must first register and log in to the website.

## Story

As the developer behind this project, I aimed to create an API that would serve as the backbone for a website dedicated to movie enthusiasts.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to construct an API using cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB, mongoose for data storage, and JWT for user authentication. This API empowers users to:

- Register and create accounts
- Log in
- Browse through the collection of movie trailers
- Rate and comment the movies
- Implement role-based access control, allowing administrators to manage movies and users efficiently.
