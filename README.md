# Movie Trailer Rating API

## Project Overview

The Movie Trailer Rating API is a backend solution designed to support a website where users can explore and rate movie trailers.  The project was created to complete the Backend module in the FullStack Web Development course and to enhance my web development skills using Node.js, Typescript and MongoDB. This API allows to discover movie trailers, access detailed movie information, rate and comment favorite movies. To unlock premium features such as rating movies, users must first register and log in to the website.

## Story

As the developer behind this project, I aimed to create an API that would serve as the backbone for a website dedicated to movie enthusiasts.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to construct an API using cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB, mongoose for data storage, and JWT for user authentication. This API empowers users to:

- Register and create accounts
- Log in
- Browse through the collection of movie trailers
- Rate and comment the movies
- Implement role-based access control, allowing administrators to manage movies and users efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Key Features

- User Registration and Authentication
- Browse and Search Movie Trailers
- View Detailed Movie Information
- Rate Movies
- Role-Based Access Control (Admin Features)
